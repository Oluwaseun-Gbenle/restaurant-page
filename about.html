        <p>Born of fire, tested by ice, confirmed by legions of loyal guests each day, Junior's restaurant has grown to become the undisputed home for great food done right. Founded in 2003 in Lagos, Nigeria, the restaurant began with one man's passion for perfect food but had very few guests to convince. Then a protest happened in 2001, stranding motorists and drawing them to one of the only hospitable places available - a restaurant then called lion's clubhouse. Tales of expertly grilled steaks and well done meals soon spread like wildfire, and the legend of Junior's restaurant was born.</p>
        <p>By 2006, the restaurant had spread throughout the Southeast, southwest and middle-belt of Nigeria.</p>
